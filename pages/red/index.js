                Red Tier is UC Berkeleyâ€™s premiere exclusive student driven
                tier nested in the midst of the largest ASUC sponsored design
                club on all of campus. Our red tier members have experience in
                both projected simulcasts and real world solutionmaking. Red
                tier promotes growth and exploration among members as well as
                dedication and social motivation. We emphasize contemporary
                values over dated and pedantic traditionalistic views, as we
                are always in the forefront of novel applications in the UC
                Berkeley community. Over the course of its history, red tier
                has developed and grown to become a renowned organization that
                others use as an example for Berkeley leadership and ideals.
